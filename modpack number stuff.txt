BINARY color sheme:
    orange: 1 , left from orange:2, left from that: 8 , this for 8 colors,
    BOTTOM row orange: 256, left from that 512, also for another 8 colors.
    total of 16 colors
   
DECIMAL color sheme:
    orange: 1st digit, left from that 2nd digit, this for 8 colors,
    BOTTOM row orange: 9th digit, left from that 10th digit, also for another 8 colors.
    TOP row orange digit 0.1, left from it 0.01, and so on for 8 colors.
    total of 24 colors
 
 
Number Block:
1)
    INPUT: logic(switches, gates, buttons,...)
        = Binary -> number
        logic inputs have binary weights based on the binary color sheme.
		
    INPUT: one number block
        = split number into digits
        gets digit from input number based on own color (decimal color sheme)
        exception: white/black(colors not in the color sheme)
            when the current block is white(/..) it'll get the full value from the input(it'll carry the '-' too)
		
    INPUT: multiple number blocks
        = combine digits into number
        input numbers get combined into 1 number based on their colors (decimal color sheme)

    OUTPUT: number block(colored)
        = split number into digits
        colored output number blocks get the digit based on the decimal color sheme from the current block.
        exception: white/black(colors not in the color sheme)
            when the destination is white(/..) it'll get the full value (it'll carry the '-' too)

    OUTPUT: logic (gate, light, ...)
        = number -> binary
        current block will get the bit from the input number based on color (binary color sheme) to the logic

5)	
    (from example) (from binary 0101 0101 to number, back to binary)
    binary numbers to digits, these digits colored combined into a block give a bigger number,
    this bigger number can be split into 2 digits using number blocks,
    number blocks with logic as output connected to these 2 digits will convert the digits into binary again
6)
    (from example) (showing carrying values)
    any value gets carried over number blocks colored white/black/not in colorsheme,
    digits hold the digit value, not the full input number value.
7)
    (example!)
    multiple colored number blocks to one will combine the digits into a value based on color
    one colored number block to one other number blocks will not set the value based on color (that would be a random * 10 or *100 or...)
8)
    (example!)
    negative values get carried over white(/..),
    a number split into digits will not carry a '-'
9)
    (example!)
    using the top row colors to show digits after the decimal point

Counter Block:
1)
    INPUTS: 2 , same color
        = count up, count down
        first input will count up, 2nd will count down (plz don't use, use color values (next one))
        pressing 'e' on the counter will reset it!
2)
    INPUTS: 2, one top row, one bottom row
        = count up, count down
        for the counter it uses the decimal color sheme but with a slight twist,
        the bottom row is the negative of the 2nd row
        > use orange and dark orange to count up and down
        > pressing 'e' on the counter will reset it!
3)
    INPUTS: lots, colored
        = count up , count down, fast
        the decimal color sheme but with a slight twist,
        the bottom row is the negative of the 2nd row
        > white is reset
        > pressing 'e' on the counter will reset it!
		
	INPUTS: NUMBER inputs
		= count up/down based on value of number input, color of input number block is also important!
		> **RED** input number '2' , count up by 20 every tick
// END of counter block
 
 
 
Tick Button:
1)
    the tick button behaves exactly like a normal button.
    but will only output one tick, even when pressed for a longer time.
2)
    the tick button can be activated by logic input to 'convert' the input to a single tick
    multiple inputs: any input on triggers it, any input held down will block other inputs from reactivation.
3)
    the tick button can be configured to stay activated for longer than a tick by hooking a number input to it.
//END of tick button
 
 
 
Smart sensor:
1)
    the smart sensor will give extreme accurate number reading of how far an object is. (digits behind decimal point too!)
2)
    the smart sensor has 2 modes: THIN (like vanilla sensor) and WIDE, wide is more accurate as shown in the example.

	> there are 2 more modes added: color mode, it'll output the color it detects (range 0 - 16581375)
//END of smart sensor
